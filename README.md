# Machine Learning Nanodegree

Projects required for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity. The program teaches you how to build machine learning models and apply them to data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more. This is a one term program spread over 6 months. 

## Exploring the Titanic Survival Data. Introductory Project

In this project Pandas and Numpy are used to analyze a real dataset of passengers on the Titanic. Based on this information, the survival of the passengers is predicted.

## Model Evaluation Validation: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

In this project, I evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about the monetary value of a home. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The Boston Housing dataset contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

_The model uses a Decision Tree Algorithm. The work is done on a template Jupyter Notebook provided by Udacity. The code is written in Python 3 using NumPy and Pandas._

## Deep Learning: Dog Breed Recognition Project

Use Keras to build a convolutional neural network to recognize dog breeds from images. Furthermore, if an image of a human is provided, the algorithm will guess which breed of dog looks the most like that human. Improve the results by using pre-trained networks.

## Reinforcement Learning: Teach a Quadcopter to Fly

Use deep reinforcement learning to design a simulated quadcopter that learns to take off, hover, and land, all by itself. Integrate these behaviors into a single end-to-end system, that can autonomously fly from point A to point B

## Capstone Project

This is your turn to shine! In this project you'll be able to distinguish yourself by building a machine learning to solve a problem that you are passionate about, using any dataset of your choice. Our network of expert reviewers will guide you through your proposal phase, and will give you solid feedback on your model, your data, and your procedure.
