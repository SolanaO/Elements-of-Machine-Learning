# Machine Learning Nanodegree

Projects required for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity. The program teaches you how to build machine learning models and apply them to data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more. This is a one term program spread over 6 months. 

## Exploring the Titanic Survival Data

_Project 0_: Use Pandas and Numpy are used to analyze a real dataset of passengers on the Titanic. Based on this information, the survival of the passengers is predicted. This is an introductory project.

## Model Evaluation Validation: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

_Project 1_: Use Scikit-Learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in Boston. Build and optimize a model to predict the price of houses, based on their features.

I evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts and available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about the monetary value of a home. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

_The model uses a Decision Tree Algorithm. The work is done on a template Jupyter Notebook provided by Udacity. The code is written in Python 3 using NumPy and Pandas._

## Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML

_Project 2_: Build a classification model to identify the best potential donors for a charity. Use several classification algorithms and optimize them for quality.

I employ three supervised algorithms (Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest) to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census, and available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). From preliminary results, the best candidate algorithm is Random Forest. I further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.

## Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments

Study a real dataset of customers for a company, apply several unsupervised learning techniques in order to extract valuable information from this data.

## Deep Learning: Dog Breed Recognition Project

Use Keras to build a convolutional neural network to recognize dog breeds from images. Furthermore, if an image of a human is provided, the algorithm will guess which breed of dog looks the most like that human. Improve the results by using pre-trained networks.

## Reinforcement Learning: Teach a Quadcopter to Fly

Use deep reinforcement learning to design a simulated quadcopter that learns to take off, hover, and land, all by itself. Integrate these behaviors into a single end-to-end system, that can autonomously fly from point A to point B

## Capstone Project

This is your turn to shine! In this project you'll be able to distinguish yourself by building a machine learning to solve a problem that you are passionate about, using any dataset of your choice. Our network of expert reviewers will guide you through your proposal phase, and will give you solid feedback on your model, your data, and your procedure.
