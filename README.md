# Machine Learning Nanodegree

Projects required for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity. The program teaches you how to build machine learning models and apply them to data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more. This is an one term program spread over 6 months. 

## Exploring the Titanic Survival Data. Introductory Project

In this project Pandas and Numpy are used to analyze a real dataset of passengers on the Titanic. Based on this information, the survival of the passengers is predicted.

## Model Evaluation Validation: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Use Scikit-Learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in Boston. Build and optimize a model to predict the price of houses, based on their features.

## Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML

Build a classification model to identify the best potential donors for a charity. Use several classification algorithms and optimize them for quality.

## Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments

Study a real dataset of customers for a company, apply several unsupervised learning techniques in order to extract valuable information from this data.

## Deep Learning: Dog Breed Recognition Project

Use Keras to build a convolutional neural network to recognize dog breeds from images. Furthermore, if an image of a human is provided, the algorithm will guess which breed of dog looks the most like that human. Improve the results by using pre-trained networks.

## Reinforcement Learning: Teach a Quadcopter to Fly

Use deep reinforcement learning to design a simulated quadcopter that learns to take off, hover, and land, all by itself. Integrate these behaviors into a single end-to-end system, that can autonomously fly from point A to point B

## Capstone Project

This is your turn to shine! In this project you'll be able to distinguish yourself by building a machine learning to solve a problem that you are passionate about, using any dataset of your choice. Our network of expert reviewers will guide you through your proposal phase, and will give you solid feedback on your model, your data, and your procedure.
