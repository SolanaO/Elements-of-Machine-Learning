# Machine Learning Nanodegree

Projects required for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity. The program teaches you how to build machine learning models and apply them to data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more. This is an one term program spread over 6 months. 


Introductory Project: Exploring the Titanic Survival Data
In this project you'll use Pandas and Numpy to analyze a real dataset of passengers on the Titanic. Based on this information, you'll be able to predict their survival.
Model Evaluation Validation: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
You'll use scikit learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in boston. You'll build and optimize a model to predict the price of houses, based on their features.
Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML
Your task will be to build a classification model to identify the best potential donors for a charity. You'll be able to use several classification algorithms and optimize them for quality.
Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments
You will study a real dataset of customers for a company, and you'll apply several unsupervised learning techniques in order to extract valuable information from this data.
Deep Learning: Dog Breed Recognition Project
In this project you will use Keras to build a convolutional neural network to recognize dog breeds from images. Furthermore, if an image of a human is provided, the algorithm will guess which breed of dog looks the most like that human. You'll also be able to improve your results significantly by using pre-trained networks.
Reinforcement Learning: Teach a Quadcopter to Fly
In this project you'll use deep reinforcement learning to design a simulated quadcopter that learns to take off, hover, and land, all by itself. As a bonus, you'll be able to integrate these behaviors into a single end-to-end system, that can autonomously fly from point A to point B
Capstone Project
This is your turn to shine! In this project you'll be able to distinguish yourself by building a machine learning to solve a problem that you are passionate about, using any dataset of your choice. Our network of expert reviewers will guide you through your proposal phase, and will give you solid feedback on your model, your data, and your procedure.
